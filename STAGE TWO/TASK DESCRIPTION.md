Task 2.1: Microbiology
Look at this dataset here.
This is the description of the dataset . [open in a new tab, not a file to be downloaded]
Plot all the growth curves of OD600 vs Time for the different Strains with the following instructions
For each strain, plot a growth curve of the the knock out (-) an knock in (+) strain overlaid on top of each other
Using your function from last stage, determine the time to reach the carrying capacity for each strain/mutant
Generate a scatter plot of the time it takes to reach carrying capacity for the knock out and the knock in strains
Generate a box plot of the time it takes to reach carrying capacity for the knock out and the knock in strains
Is there a statistical difference in the time it takes the knock out strains to reach their maximum carrying capacity compared to the knock in strains
What do you see? Explain your observations as comments in your code



Task 2.6: Transcriptomics
This is a processed RNAseq dataset involving reading in quantitated gene expression data from an RNA-seq experiment, exploring the data using base R functions and then interpretation. The dataset contains an experiment between a diseased cell line and diseased cell lines treated with compound X. The difference in expression change between the two health status is computed as Fold change to log 2 (Log2FC) and the significance of each is computed in p-value.

Task:
Generate a volcano plot. (Hint search for volcano plot online)
Determine the upregulated genes (Genes with Log2FC > 1 and pvalue < 0.01)
Determine the downregulated genes (Genes with Log2FC < -1 and pvalue < 0.01)
What are the functions of the top 5 upregulated genes and top 5 downregulated genes. (Use genecards)





Task 2.7: Public Health
NHANES is a program run by the CDC to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the US. It combines survey questions and physical examinations, including medical and physiological measurements and laboratory tests, and examines a representative sample of about 5,000 people each year. The data is used to determine the prevalence of diseases and risk factors, establish national standards, and support epidemiology studies and health sciences research. This information helps to develop public health policy, design health programs and services, and expand the nation's health knowledge.
