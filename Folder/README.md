HackBio Stage Zero - Team Glycine  

**Project Description  **
This repository contains the HackBio Stage Zero assignment for Team Glycine.  

The script defines a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a person with details such as:  
- Name  
- Slack Username  
- Email  
- Hobby  
- Country  
- Discipline (Field of Study)  
- Programming Language  

The program then prints out each person's details using formatted strings by accessing each person's information through index positions and dictionary keys.
